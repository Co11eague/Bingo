# Bingo

In real life, bingo is a competitive game of chance where numbers are repeatedly drawn in a true random sequence from a pre-determined set by a person, known as a ‘caller’, or by a machine. Fresh numbers are drawn 5 until the first player to realise they have matched a winning pattern on their bingo card announces this win aloud, typically shouting ‘house’ or ‘bingo.’ If multiple players complete a winning pattern simultaneously, the winner is the first to shout out. A bingo card, also known as a ‘ticket,’ is a grid of (mostly) nonconsecutive numbers.

The program can:
1. set the dimensions of the bingo cards (rows by columns);
2. set the numbers contained on every bingo card in the game;
3. process sequences of numbers to be ‘called’; 20
4. mark matched numbers on all bingo cards currently in use;
5. test whether a bingo card is a fullhouse winner.

This program was done in Java when I was learning object-oriented programming. It also has test files.
